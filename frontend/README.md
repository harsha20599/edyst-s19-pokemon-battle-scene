# Pokemon Battle Scene

This project contains the pokemon battle scene. It is a complete static UI without any functionality.

# Getting Started

To get this running in your local machine, download the project and open the ``` index.html ``` file in your browser.

# Here are few screenshots

This UI is completely responsive design and supports dynamic data. Means, It could adjust to any image, dynamic power bar etc.

Another idea of this design is, the color of the score-card changes with respect to the health of the pokemon. For example, if the pokemon has 100 points, then the card color is turned red. If health is near to the upper limit, then it is in green.

Except the background image and pokemon images, everything else is written in HTML and CSS.
