# Pokemon Battle Scene

This project contains the pokemon battle scene. It is a complete static UI without any functionality.

## Getting Started

To get this running in your local machine, download the project and open the ``` index.html ``` file in your browser.

> Here are few screenshots

This UI is completely responsive and supports dynamic data. Means, It could adjust to any image, power bar value, different attack names etc.

Another functionality idea of this design is, the color of the score-card changes with respect to the health of the pokemon. For example, if the pokemon has 100 out of 1000 points, then the card color is turned red. If health is near to the upper limit, then it is in green. This will make the user more engaged and feel fun while using the system.

Except the background image and pokemon images, everything else is written in HTML and CSS.
